Jonathan - I believe he is the future of this company and I don't have faith in him as a leader.

Environment:
  Part of the fun of software for me is the need to always be learning and the ever present opportunity to improve as better tools become available and as needs evolve. I see that balancing act as an art, and I think that this is a common feeling among many developers. I don't feel that's how it is here, which is fine, but not the enrivonment I am wanting.
  Because of this attitude, I was called in to Dan's office, along with Michael and Dustin, and reprimanded. He said, I don't care about making your lives easier, I care about the customer. I'm wanting to make sure you all are on board with the way we do things. This has been one of my few interactions with Dan.
  I am not board with how things are done here, and I know that there are other companies out there who promote an environment that is more in line with what I am wanting.
  We are using a 20 year old customer support ticketing system to manage software development, we are using antiquated frameworks, we don't adhere to industry best practices, which makes it difficult for an off the street dev to come on board and quickly become a valuable contributor.
  Org Chart: Dan, Jonathan and Randy, then everyone else...it's not very clear what everyone's function is, how to relate to other team members, what they are working on, if they've encountered problems that I'm encountering, how to help each other, etc. It's all very nebulous. I feel I should be reporting to another developer.

Other opportunities to provide for my family.

All of that to say, I'm putting in my notice to resign at Baytek.

I think Randy is a brilliant visionary, and I admire the way that you think about things. I'm so glad that I am able to call you my brother in Christ
